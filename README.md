# Capstone Product Plan: "RoomService"

###Problem Statement:

There isn’t an easy and secure way to find compatible roommates through the currently available web applications.

###Market Research:

<b>Competition</b>  
It is well known in Seattle that the process of finding affordable rooms for rent is tedious and inefficient due to the lack of decently priced housing and high influx of people moving into Seattle.  

From personal experience and input from others in my network, I found that Craigslist is the widely most used platform to search and advertise for available housing. However, Craigslist doesn’t require any of the important information that most people would want to see in a housing post, which makes it very inconvenient. Also, if a user wants to find a room that’s only in Seattle, the results can include many posts that are not in the city.  It is also very common to email a host and get a reply that ends up being spam. Searching for the genuine posts, and then seeing results that don’t even match the user’s basic criteria can be very frustrating. Decently priced rooms go quickly, so having that process slowed down makes it even more difficult.

RoomieMatch requires users to answer every question in their extremely long survey. Many of the required questions that they use to filter out potential matches are trivial and situational which restricts the number of potentially compatible roommates.

<b>Differentiation</b>  
RoomService will allow housing posts and room seekers that meet each other’s criteria to be searchable by each other. They can only get into contact through the application if they mutually express interest in one another.

There are basic details of the housing post that will be required—rental price, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, neighborhood, lease-length, pets, smoking, etc. Not requiring extensive information gives a wider pool of *compatible* roommates since many of those living-situation questions are better determined via discussion.

Swiping through their respective search results, users are only allowed to contact each other if they are “matched” meaning that both selected “yes” to each other’s profiles. My in-app messaging feature makes it secure without comprising any contact information.  

RoomService will have an enhanced verification process to make sure that every room post is valid along with requiring basic information about the room. While it seems like this might deter room hosts since they tend to get many inquires on Craigslist, it’ll actually make their experience better as well. Only being contacted by those who meet their requirements will reduce the number of messages flooding their inbox from ineligible room seekers who didn’t read their post clearly.

###User Personas: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?  

There are two user types: Hosts and Room Seekers. Each user-type can look for the other type and are required to sign up with some kind of additional verification. Hosts are the users who are advertising their room for rent. In a host’s housing ad, they’re *required* to include basic information that most people would want to see. Room Seekers are users who are looking for a room for rent. They can swipe through compatible housing posts using their desired criteria as a filter. Seekers will have a short biography about themselves that the Hosts can use as criteria for a potential match as well.
