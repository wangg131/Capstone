# Capstone Product Plan: "RoomService"

###Problem Statement:

`There isn’t an easy and secure way to find compatible roommates through the currently available web applications.`

<b>Background</b>
It's well known in Seattle that finding affordable rooms for rent is a rat race due to the lack of decently priced housing and high influx of people moving into the city.

###Market Research:

<b>Competition</b>   
From personal experience and input from others in my network, Craigslist is inconvenient because it doesn't have any requirements for housing posts. Many posts can be missing important details that are useful for room seekers. Oftentimes, a seeker will email about a post only to find out that the room isn't even located in their desired area. It's also very common to get a spam response from a listing. Decently priced rooms go quickly, so having that process slowed down makes it even more difficult.

Roomie Match requires all users to answer every question in their extremely long survey and matches them according to their responses. Many of the required questions were situational which can restrict the number of potentially compatible roommates.

Easyroommate allows seekers to upload a personal photo. This isn't ideal, because room-poster can deny a seeker just based on preconceived notions about their appearance.

<b>Differentiation</b>  
RoomService will pre-filter to eliminate roommates who don't meet the user's criteria from the search results. Also, only the basic details of the housing post will be required. Not requiring superfluous information nor allowing seeker profile photos will give a wider pool of *compatible* roommates to potentially match with.

RoomService's verification process will make sure that every user is valid. The in-app messaging feature makes it secure without comprising any contact information. The room-posters wont be getting a flood of emails from incompatible seekers since they can only message one another if they mutually expressed interest.

###User Personas: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?  

There are two user types: Hosts and Seekers.

Hosts are the users who are advertising a room for rent, and they have a room post. In their post, they’re *required* to include basic information that most people would want to see in a listing— rental price, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, neighborhood, lease-length, pets, smoking, etc. They can look for Seekers to fill their rooms.

Seekers are people who are looking for a room, and they have a profile with a bio/description. They are required to have a profile bio and their profiles are viewed by prospective Hosts. Seekers are required to input room preferences.

Each user-type can only search for the opposite user-type with compatible attributes. This compatibility filtering will come from the Hosts' input about their room and the Seekers' preferences. They can message each other after getting matched from mutually expressing interest.
